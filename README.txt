# LISP-Interpreter
This project is a implementation of the LISP language using C# based on the book _Crafting Inpertpreters_ by Robert Nystrom 

The LISPInterpreter bin contains all the relevant code for this project.

Since there only the scanner and the parser are included. There are not many test cases to give but a couple have been provided 
If you wish to test it I recommend compiling the code and using the command prompt to test it
